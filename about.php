				<h1 class="title font-overlock">We are about the good news of Jesus Christ</h1>
				<p>Our vision is to collaborate with God, as his family on mission, in the rescue and restoration of all things through Jesus Christ as a continually expanding church of churches.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">A Church of Churches.</h2>
				<p>The South Bay City Church is a network of churches, or church of churches. The network is composed of individual church communities who are covenantally committed to the gospel, the teachings of Christ and one another. While each church has their own leadership (<a href="http://esvbible.org/1+tim+3" title="See 1 Timothy 3" target="_blank" rel="external">1 Tim. 3</a>) recognized by the network leadership, there are also network leaders who work among the churches in order to strengthen and equip the saints (<a href="http://esvbible.org/eph+4:11" title="See Ephesians 4:11" target="_blank" rel="external">Eph. 4:11</a>).</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">Vision for Expansion</h2>
				<p>We are praying for the Spirit to spread the gospel throughout the South San Francisco Bay Area, and specifically within our sphere in San Jose, Campbell, and the surrounding communities. We seek to partner with God and other churches in the founding, shaping and nurturing of churches and networks of churches for the blessing of our cities.</p>
 
				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">The Gospel</h2>
				<p>The gospel is the good news about Jesus Christ. Jesus is God's promised Rescuer and Ruler, who lived our life perfectly, died our death unjustly, and rose triumphantly as the first of the new humanity where forgiven sinners live together under his gracious reign.</p>
 
				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">The Teachings of Christ</h2>
				<p>The teachings of Christ began with the life and words of Jesus and were continued by the Spirit through the Apostles (<a href="http://esvbible.org/acts+1:1-2" title="See Acts 1:1-2" target="_blank" rel="external">Acts 1:1-2</a>). We have summarized these teachings in categories outlined by Jesus and his Apostles in the New Testament as biblical values that shape the individual and community life of believers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Discipleship as Maturity in Christ</em> &ndash; Establishing, or confirming, a solid conversion to life with God through apprenticeship to Christ. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/phil+3:7-14" title="See Philippians 3:7-14" target="_blank" rel="external">Phil. 3:7-14</a>)
					<li><em>Church as Family</em> &ndash; Enfolding our lives into the people of God as local families of faith. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/eph+2:19-22" title="See Ephesians 2:19-22" target="_blank" rel="external">Eph. 2:19-22</a>)
					<li><em>&ldquo;Household&rdquo; as Mission</em> &ndash; Developing our &ldquo;households&rdquo; as outposts of God's Kingdom in search of persons of peace. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/1+peter+2:1-12" title="See 1 Peter 2:1-12" target="_blank" rel="external">1 Pt. 2:1-12</a> &amp; <a href="http://esvbible.org/luke+10:2-6" title="See Luke 10:2-6" target="_blank" rel="external">Lk. 10:2-6</a>)
					<li><em>True Life as Knowing God</em> &ndash; Growing in being loved and known by God in every aspect of our thinking and living. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/john+17:3" title="See John 17:3" target="_blank" rel="external">Jn. 17:3</a>)
					<li><em>Marriage and Relationships as Gospel Proclamations</em> &ndash; Cultivating Christ-centered relationships that proclaim our trust in God. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/john+13:34-35" title="See John 13:34-35" target="_blank" rel="external">Jn. 13:34-35</a>)
					<li><em>Family as a Lifestyle of Teaching</em> &ndash; Passing on the life and teachings of Christ in familial relationships and everyday life. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/deut+6:4-9" title="See Deuteronomy 6:4-9" target="_blank" rel="external">Deut. 6:4-9</a> &amp; <a href="http://esvbible.org/eph+6:4" title="See Ephesians 6:4" target="_blank" rel="external">Eph. 6:4</a>)
					<li><em>Vocation as Lifework</em> &ndash; Discerning, with others and the Spirit, the total good that God has planned for us to do in blessing our family, church, workplace, and community. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/eph+6:4" title="See Ephesians 2:10" target="_blank" rel="external">Eph. 2:10</a>)
					<li><em>Legacy as Kingdom Living</em> &ndash; Envisioning a heritage of dependence on and collaboration with God for his eternal purposes. (<a href="http://esvbible.org/matt+6:33" title="See Matthew 6:33" target="_blank" rel="external">Matt. 6:33</a>)</li>
				</ul>
