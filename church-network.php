				<p><em>Our network is growing through the spread of the gospel.</em> Our network grows as believers partner together with the Spirit in the spread of the gospel through the founding, shaping and nurturing of church networks.</p>
				<p>Our network's missional expression is <em>Misseo Kaleo</em>, a non-profit that represents a covenantal relationship between leaders and churches committed to seeing networks of churches planted, growing and multiplying throughout the world. We currently work with leaders, churches and networks in North America, South America, India, and Southeast Asia. Our passion is to live gospel-appealing lives, be led by the Spirit, and exercise loving leadership for spontaneous expansion of the gospel.</p>
