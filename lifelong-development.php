				<h1 class="title font-overlock">Lifelong Learning</h1>
				<p><em>We offer lifelong learning opportunities for everyone.</em> In order to strengthen believers, families, and churches, while developing future leaders, we provide ongoing learning opportunities for all ages.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">The Curious</h2>
				<p>For those interested in finding out more about God without attending a church, we have a 13-week Walkthrough of the Story of God. In the midst of a world that sends us many different messages about who Jesus is, we follow Jesus' explanation of himself by using the larger story of the Scriptures. We would be happy to help you, your family, or friends on this journey in your home or ours.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">Adults</h2>
				<p>For those 13 and older, we encourage believers to engage in a several year process of being firmly grounded in the gospel and teachings of Christ. We have a pattern of ordered learning for leaders, heads of households, and older believers to use in helping people be solid in their conversion, established in the principles of the faith, and growing in their love and devotion to the Lord.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle font-overlock">Leadership Development</h2>
				<p>For men and women desiring to contribute to the expansion of the gospel, we offer an ongoing rigorous church-based theological and practicum-focused training. Our desire is to recognize and release believers in their gifting and calling as leading women, church hosts, deacons, elders, benefactors, co-workers in gospel expansion, and apostolic leaders. We have short-term, long-term, and accredited approaches to leadership development. Contact us to find out more:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Church Planting or Leadership Apprenticeship:</em> a 6-month long apprenticeship in the gospel, the teachings of Christ, and the pattern of community and mission of the Early Church. This time is designed for those who desire to contribute in church leadership or church planting efforts, having been recommended by their local church leadership.</li>
					<li><em>Long-Term Development:</em> each summer we offer one of four core studies: Acts, Paul’s Letters, the Essentials of the Faith, or Leadership in the Early Church. We hope everyone in our churches will do each of these studies at least one time.</li>
					<li><em>Antioch School of Church Planting and Leadership Development:</em> as a certified partner in this church-based theological school, people can be trained for ministry and receive accredited Certificates, Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorates in Ministry or Theology while participating in the life and mission of our churches. You can find out more about the Antioch School’s degree programs offered through our network at their website.</li>
				</ul>
